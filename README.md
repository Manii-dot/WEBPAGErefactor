#Webpage Refactor

The marketing agency wanted a codebase that follows accessibilty standards so that their site is optimized for search.

#When I view the source code I find semantic elements to be div heavy and unproperly anotated and reduntant. All div were replace with proper element name.
#When I view the structure of the HTML elements I reorganized CSS to follow the logical structure
#Alt attributes were added to respective image elements
#CSS elements were all properly group reflecting updated as so to match the respective of that of HTML elements 

#Both CSS and HTML codes are clean and easier to read and follow.
